<section id='description'>
	<p>This is a page built to showcase what has been learned thus far. The image slider at the top of this page is built using a mixture of jQuery and plain Javascript, for example. The arrows are coded with jQuery and Javascript as well. The button was the use of source code and slight modification of the code to bring about the optimum output. The page has been laid out for best fit for a desktop, but will soon be laid out with a mobile phone layout! Give it some time, and it will be on the way. By the way, all of this is just test text.</p>
